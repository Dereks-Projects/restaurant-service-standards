                I'm Derek Engles, and I've spent over 20 years building and leading service teams 
                at properties like Wynn Resorts and MGM Grandâ€”establishments where "good enough" 
                doesn't exist.

              <p className="about-founder__text">
                After training hundreds of employees and developing service standards from scratch 
                for luxury properties pursuing Forbes and Michelin recognition, I noticed something: 
                the best training knowledge was locked away in expensive consultants or buried in 
                outdated manuals that no one actually used.
              </p>
              <p className="about-founder__text">
                Restaurant Standards is the training system I wish I had when I was developing 
                programs for enterprise hospitality groups. It's every hard-won lesson, every 
                service standard, every training technique that actually moved the needleâ€”now 
                accessible to any restaurant or hotel serious about excellence.
